## Hangman game - written in python 3.11


This is a simple CLI-based hangman game where the player will be prompted for
some input and has to guess which word the computer (opponent) is looking for. You start out with 5 lives, each
error you make will deduct 1 life point. The game will finish once your life points hit 0 or if you manage to find
the correct word!

Good Luck!
